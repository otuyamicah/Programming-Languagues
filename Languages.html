            Often abbreviated as "JS", is an interpreted programming language that coforms to the ECMAscripts
                specification.
                <br /> <i>Javascripts is high-level, often just-in time compiled, and multi-paradigm. it has
                    curly-brackets syntax, dynamic-typing, prototype-base object-orentation and first-class
                    functions.</i>
