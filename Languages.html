  <body>
    <p>
        A programming language, is a notation designed to connect instructions to the machine or a computer.</br>
        programming languages are mainly used to to control the performance of a machine or to express ALGORITHMS.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>JAVASCRIPTS:</b></li>
            Often abbreviated as "JS", is an interpreted programming language that coforms to the ECMAscripts
                specification.
                <br /> <i>Javascripts is high-level, often just-in time compiled, and multi-paradigm. it has
                    curly-brackets syntax, dynamic-typing, prototype-base object-orentation and first-class
                    functions.</i>

         <ul>
             <li><b>FRAMEWORKS:</b></li>
             A framework defines the entire application design..

         </ul>

    </br>
    

        <ul>
           <li><b>FUN FACTS ABOUT JAVASCRIPTS</b></li>
            JAVASCRIPTS is a most prefered language because of it compatability with all th major browers and it really flexible with the syntax it holds.
            Being a front-end language, Javascripts is also used on the server-side through NODE.JS
